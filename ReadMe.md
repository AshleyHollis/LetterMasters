# Letter Masters

## Definition

LetterMasters is a progressive organisation that is transforming their development systems and processes. They need C# developers who leverage the Microsoft cloud-based DevOps and hosting environments. 
An important requirement has been identified to base 64 encode a series of alpha characters. This is commonly known as a “word”. It is important for this initial API to accept only alpha characters. Rumour has it that some keyboards now allow the use of strange characters and even spaces! This is strictly against company policy as they have a tightly enforced one word only standard.
